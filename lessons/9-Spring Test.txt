Spring provides a comprehensive testing framework that allows you to fully test your 
applications. Below are some key concepts and features:

TestContext Framework: This is the core part of Spring's testing support. It provides support 
                        for creating and managing Spring application contexts for testing, 
                        caching those contexts, dependency injection of test instances, 
                        transactional test management, etc.

Spring Boot Test: Spring Boot provides additional utilities and auto-configuration for 
                    testing Spring Boot applications. This includes automatic configuration 
                    of an application context, mock beans, utilities for testing web 
                    applications, etc.

Types of Tests:

    Unit Tests: These are simple tests that test a single component (like a service or 
                repository) in isolation. Spring provides Mockito and MockBean for creating 
                mock objects in unit tests.

    Integration Tests: These are tests that check the interaction of multiple components. 
                        Spring provides @SpringBootTest annotation which can be used to 
                        create an application context for integration tests.

    Web Tests: These tests verify the interaction of the web layer (controllers) without 
                starting a server. @WebMvcTest can be used for tests that only need Spring 
                MVC components. Spring Boot also provides TestRestTemplate and WebTestClient 
                for testing REST APIs.

Testing Annotations:

    @SpringBootTest: This annotation tells Spring Boot to look for the main configuration 
                        class and use that to create an application context.

    @WebMvcTest: This annotation is used for Spring MVC tests. It disables full auto-configuration 
                    and only applies configuration relevant to MVC tests.

    @DataJpaTest: This annotation is used for JPA tests. It disables full auto-configuration and only 
                    applies configuration relevant to JPA tests.

    @MockBean: This annotation can be used to add mock objects to the Spring application context. 
                The mock will replace any existing bean of the same type in the application context.

    @TestPropertySource: This annotation is used to specify locations of property files specific 
                            to the tests.

    @AutoConfigureMockMvc: This annotation can be used along with @SpringBootTest to inject a MockMvc 
                            instance for testing web controllers.

Here's an example of a simple Spring Boot test:

        @SpringBootTest
        class EmployeeServiceTests {

            @Autowired
            private EmployeeService employeeService;

            @MockBean
            private EmployeeRepository employeeRepository;

            @Test
            void testFindAll() {
                Employee employee = new Employee();
                employee.setName("John Doe");
                employee.setSalary(1000);
                List<Employee> employees = Arrays.asList(employee);

                Mockito.when(employeeRepository.findAll()).thenReturn(employees);

                Iterable<Employee> result = employeeService.findAll();

                Assertions.assertTrue(result.iterator().hasNext());
            }
        }

In this example, we are testing the EmployeeService's findAll() method. 
We use @MockBean to create a mock of EmployeeRepository, and we define its behavior 
using Mockito's when() and thenReturn() methods. Then we call the method under test 
and verify the result using JUnit's Assertions.
