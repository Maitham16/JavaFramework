Form validation is an essential part of any application that involves user input. 
Validation ensures that the data entered by the user matches the expected format 
and constraints of the application.

Spring provides several ways to handle form validation. One of the most common is 
to use the @Valid annotation in combination with the `BindingResult` interface.

Here is a simple example of a Spring controller method using this form validation:

        @PostMapping("/user")
        public String saveUser(@Valid @ModelAttribute("user") User user, BindingResult bindingResult) {
            if (bindingResult.hasErrors()) {
                return "form";
            }
            // Save the user
            userRepository.save(user);
            return "redirect:/success";
        }

In the above example, when a POST request is made to "/user", the @Valid annotation tells Spring to 
validate the User object. If there are any validation errors (e.g., a required field is missing, a number 
is outside the required range, etc.), they are stored in the BindingResult object.

        The User class may look something like this:

        public class User {

            @NotEmpty(message = "Name is required.")
            private String name;

            @NotEmpty(message = "Email is required.")
            private String email;

            @Size(min = 6, message = "Password must be at least 6 characters.")
            private String password;

            // getters and setters
        }

Here, @NotEmpty and @Size are constraint annotations provided by the Bean Validation API (a Java standard). 
The message attribute allows us to specify the error message that will be displayed when the constraint is violated.
