To become proficient in Spring Boot, here are some topics you might want to explore next:

    Dependency Injection: Spring Framework is built on the concept of Dependency Injection, 
    which can help to increase the efficiency and modularity of your code. Learn about how 
    you can use Spring's IoC container to manage your beans and dependencies.

    Spring Data JPA: This module deals with enhanced support for JPA based data access layers. 
    It makes it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use data access technologies.

    Spring Security: This is a framework that focuses on providing both authentication and 
    authorization to Java applications. You will want to learn how to secure your Spring Boot 
    application using Spring Security.

    Spring AOP: The Spring AOP module integrates aspect-oriented programming functionality 
    directly into the Spring framework, through its configuration management feature. It's a 
    key component of Spring which can be used to modularize cross-cutting concerns.

    Testing: Spring provides a good abstraction on top of the JUnit (or TestNG) framework to 
    make it easier to test the Spring components with JUnit (or TestNG) tests, using a simple 
    annotation-based model.

    Spring MVC: Although not strictly necessary when using Spring Boot, it can be helpful to 
    understand how Spring MVC works, since Spring Boot is built on top of it.

    Microservices with Spring Boot: Once you have a good understanding of Spring Boot, you 
    might want to learn about how you can use it to build microservices, which are small, 
    independent processes that communicate with each other to form a complete system.

    Remember, the key to mastering Spring Boot (or any framework or technology, for that 
    matter) is practice. Try to build a variety of applications with it, experiment with 
    different features, and don't be afraid to dive into the documentation or source code 
    if you're not sure about something.
